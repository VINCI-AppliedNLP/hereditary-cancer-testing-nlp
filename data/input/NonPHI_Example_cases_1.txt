RESULT OF PREVIOUS MOLECULAR TESTING:
Genetic analysis of 5 genes known to be associated with Lynch syndrome (EPCAM, 
MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2,) was NEGATIVE, therefore an identifiable mutation was 
not found in any of these genes. This substantially reduces the chance the 
Veteran has a genetic change that increases his risk for colon cancer and 
essentially rules out Lynch syndrome.

.-------- -------- -------- --------.


Interpretation:
No pathogenic variant in BRCA1 or BRCA2 was detected by
full gene sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis.

.-------- -------- -------- --------.

No pathogenic MSH2 gene mutations were detected by either 
bidirectional sequencing of the coding regions and intron/e

No pathogenic mutations, variants of unknown significance, or 
gross deletions or duplications were detected in the other genes 
analyzed. In total, 18 genes were analyzed as part of this panel: 
ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BRIP1, CDH1, CHEK2, MRE11A, MUTYH, NBN, 
NF1, PALB2, PTEN, RAD50, RAD51C, RAD51D, STK11, and TP53.
